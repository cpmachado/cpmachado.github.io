TL&DR: Managed to recover throughout the day, and played the following. Had a
completely lost game, but my opponent blundered and I managed to win. It was
an unsavory victory, as my opponent accused me of cheating. It put things in
perspective.

The situation was despicable. Misery and beyond misery was my situation, until
my opponent blundered with 29. ...Qc4, and I found Rd7.


## Aftermath

After resigning, and unlike proper protocol, my opponent went to complain
about me allegedly cheating, thus compromising my honour. In pain, and in
fury, I demanded he present an official complaint, to which he just cowardly
ran away.

This incident required a proper response. As I was educated, when it comes to
honour, you don't joke or fool around with, you put your life on the line. I
sent an e-mail making a formal complaint about the whole affair, and demanding
reparations.

He admitted to the organiser of being wrong, and soon left the tournament,
after losing the round afterwards. His hubris was something that got properly
corrected, upon a superficial analysis of the game.

This situation left me absolutely disenchanted about the tournament, as you'll
soon see the rest of my games so far. The quality is deteriorating even more.

## Post writing

I was in no mood to write for the last couple days, and only found it now, as
I am going to play the 8th round. Let us see what awaits me. From the joy of
being able to play again, to a profound depression, is it not the definition
of an emotional rollercoaster?
