It's been two years to finish. The glorious day had this book by my side. I'm
talking about "Honourable Schoolboy" by John Le Carré. It appears to me that
finishing the book today is an omen of some kind, or so speaks my slightly
superstitious side. Maybe being facetious in some way is a personal trait,
can't say to have an answer.

It's the end of a cycle of drowning, or so I hope. I bought and started it,
when everything started going nasty, professionally. When something goes wrong
in life, it tends to spread like some kind of mould, and, before you know it,
everything starts to collapse.

The book was quite interesting, as it picks up a rather unremarkable character
from a previous book("Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy"), and makes it a sort of
Byronic hero. Had I been a more sensitive man, I might have started crying in
its end. Can't recommend it enough, Carré really knew how to write, and what I
found particularly curious is the meta narrative on the writing of the hero,
Honourable Jerry Westerby.

The yanks calling him Weatherby was funny in the context of thing. The whole
plot however echoed the plot of a previous "Smiley" book, which is "The Spy who
came from the cold". Can't recommend that enough either.

Well, it's been a long day. See you around dear reader.
