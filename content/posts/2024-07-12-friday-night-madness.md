It's Friday, and it was a hell of a week. My focus eludes me from time to time,
but I've been able to get a decent load done. Having a light dinner at the bar
near my place, and for misery and holy punishment a bunch of kids, idiots as
they come, are sited right next to me.

I wonder if they have enough self-awareness to know how ridiculous they look
and sound. Not quite sure, and to be honest it's of little consequence. My
patience runs thin nowadays, for the same action I'm taking as well. People are
always complaining about other people, but these kind of people just pollute
existence.

You can fantasize about their destruction, but still you're destroying your
time and energy. There's much more, and much more interesting things to
explore. Just consider the marvels of the universe around you. The products of
our species never seize to amaze me, and day by day I value more the development
of psychotropic substances such as beer or any other alcoholic beverage, and
coffee and many others.

Some keep me awake and empower my abilities, and others make life tolerable.
Can't figure out which is more important. Maybe the latter, as it actually
might be a precondition for the first. If I went on a murderous spree, I
wouldn't be able to enjoy life.

Just yesterday I reached a milestone, as I completed the Le Carr√©'s
"Smiley's Series". It was about time anyway, to take almost 3 years to read 8
books, but then again they weren't my only focus. I've found many interesting
and worthwhile books in the meantime. Since 2022, I'm still haunted by Frank
Wilczek's book, "Fundamentals: Ten Keys to Reality". It's short of an absolute
masterpiece, and everyone should read it.
