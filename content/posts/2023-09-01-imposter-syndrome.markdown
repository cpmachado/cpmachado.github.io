It has been a testing time. At every corner, self doubt crashes like
tsunami waves. A series of failures makes you doubt completely about the
ability to do just about anything. Frying an egg or washing the dishes appears
an untenable goal.

My mind has been filled up with this. It's taxing, and it makes scarce the
energy to tackle life's challenges. Some years appear to have been easier,
but it's probably just hindsight.

Maybe it's age, and that's the joke. Nearing my twenty-ninth birthday, a
career of ten years, and I mumble as a fool. A fool who appears to barely have
written a "hello, world" in his life.

Maybe it's just drama, but who knows? God, Jesus, the priest or some other
entity more capable on the patterns of life. On patterns, a small ego boost
arrived from being able to start noticing some again.

Anyhow, I've been feeling a lot like an Imposter lately, yet it just might be
the untameable obsession with mortality. It floats in the air, and makes it
thick and hard to breath.
