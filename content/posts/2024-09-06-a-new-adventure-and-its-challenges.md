Not long ago, I've started a new mission. The team's great, but my confidence
is still shaken. It's complicated to face these pressure and expectations.
These are devised and maintained by myself, against my own conscious will.

Some days I've been able to function properly, but some days are just
horrible. A word of this colleague of mine crumbles my world. The depths of my
frustration is boundless, and the strength required to keep composed is beyond
measure. I don't want to be that guy again, the one I was in the past.

It comes as an evolution from my previous adventure, in which there was a very
sensitive colleague of mine. I couldn't express plainly, as I'd be constantly
and discreetly reminded that some people are very delicate, almost as a souffle.

Now in this prison of my design, lacking the reminders, I enforce them on
myself, as I fear to trample a delicate flower. This delicate flower that
shows little mercy for others, and it's beyond my current understanding how
it forgets how the ceilings are made of glass.

Besides this challenge, technically it's been glorious, with a given amount of
frustration. Updating outdated software always is, but as you might've
noticed, it doesn't compare to people.
