Patience is the word to live by amidst the mess I'm going through. There's no
use in frustration, as I already have the need and will to change. Time is
lacking, and that's a problem not easily solved, as I myself am quite
optimized.

This situation evolves to a not so quiet resignation. My body feels it, as it
burns through energy in an unproductive way. To make matters worse, disease is
around those I love, and lacking magical powers, having all the medical
treatment possible available to them, there's nothing I can do.

Pale and motionless, I endure looking and caring for those I love, feeling
absolutely powerless. What a tragedy this Sisyphean characteristic of the human
condition is. A son, a father, a friend, a lover can do nothing whilst their
dearest suffers. Resignation appears once again, as the only enduring solution.

When patience is lacking, I go for a stroll. My mind however must figuratively
look like Swiss cheese. It makes me wonder how ridiculous I sound complaining
about life, as after all it's nothing more than human condition. What would
Jesus say about this?
