My life's been like a raft through a storm, rocking on the slightest wave. It
shakes so hard, that I've been sea sick in some kind of psychosomatic way. It's
late at night, I have an assignment, yet no will or condition to deliver. I've 
been neglecting my studies. It really makes me wonder of what I'm doing.

To be an actor of many faces and responsibilities tends to leave one lacking
time for oneself. In a rather forced hand, I've decided to cease this night to
lose myself in thought and find a way to safe port. There's need for a sturdier
ship for the travels to come, and choices must be made.

Never to want to write in stone, it does require a certain kind of rigidity
atypical to my essence. To repeat the same experience and expect different
results is madness, but let us try this slightly changed approach and maybe
it'll work alright this time around.

Sailing into the night, book in hand, and looking farther into the abyss, than
I've ever dared before.
