For the last couple years, I've been trying to improve my reading
habits. Unfortunately, they've been lacking for the last few
months. It's a new year, and just now finished the first book of the
year. Although it was a long one, that's been present for almost the
duration of this experiment, I'd normally range around half a dozen by
now, and I'm not talking about skimming.

There's a thing certain about myself, and that obsession isn't just an
abstract concept, but rather a way of living. Restless to have a
proper understanding is beyond what one might call curious. In another
life, I'd probably be an heretic breaking some religious law, because
I had to know something.

On the other side of the coin, practicality is a thing, and much like
Galileo, and not that apocryphal story, I'd care little for it if it
endangered my kin. This whom I claim to be is romanticised version of
myself, the real me is a monster with a different face.

For the last few years, my will to progress has stalled as patience
runs thin, and some sort of episode happens. There have been good
times, but not as they were some long time ago, in a very different
life I had. Some things however make it all worth it, but then again
one always wonders about the things you miss.

Maybe there's something in the water, I don't know, I just feel that
I'm lacking something I used to have.
