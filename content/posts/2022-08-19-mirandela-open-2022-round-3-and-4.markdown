TL&DR: I got sick, and had to request a bye for round 3, and was unable to
play round 4. I had to remove myself from the tournament.

## Aftermath or The End?

As I wrote in the post, "A night in pain", shortly after round 2, I was
stricken by illness. I can't compete, and it really saddens me. I've requested
a bye for round 3, but I had faith that I could play round 4.

As you might guess, it wasn't the case. I couldn't, and I'm still recovering.
In consequence of the unknowns pertaining my situation, I've removed myself
from the tournament.

It appears, there were no rounds to go.
