TL&DR: The second round of the **Mirandela Open 2022** went horribly. Beyond
reason, and in pure emotion, failure was short of disaster. Drama for everyone,
given and sold.

Another game, another loss, can't say too much about this game. As a deranged
idiot, I went back on what I was trying to do. From move 3, I was
blitzing, anxious and desperate to leave the playing hall.

It was the worst experience for me, since the last game of the last tournament
I played, which was pretty nasty. I got mated in 15 moves in the
aforementioned game, in this at least I held on for 34 moves, before
resigning.

The thought passed through my mind of Curt Von Bardeleben the game. This
means to leave, without saying a word to anyone. Better judgement came above
insanity.


## Aftermath

The overall feeling is of a profound frustration. From the start the odds were
obviously against me, I just hated how I played. Above all the act of playing
quickly.

Yesterday was a pretty solid game compared to this piece of things, that I
played. My thoughts go to that Macbeth soliloquy which deepens my existential
chess angst. It's beautiful nevertheless.

Stating the fact, there 7 rounds to go.
