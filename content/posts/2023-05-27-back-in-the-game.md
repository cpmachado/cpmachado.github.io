TL&DR: Yet again trying to write more consistently. Struggles towards a new
and better life.

---

It's been some eventful months, since the last post. I've become a father, and
returned to be a student. This time, I'm studying Mathematics. The
nights can be troubled, and worries are plenty. The joy of
fatherhood has some truth to it, regardless of the aforementioned troubles.

Lately, I've been terribly lacking in terms of my performance
professionally and academically, not for lack of skill, but of motivation.
There's so much time and mental acuity for anything. Thus it
came to me some months ago, to pivot towards cybersecurity. The dev life is
less suited to me as time passes. It's simply as recognising that I've some
sort of obsession about it, that it's not entirely healthy or conducting to a
happy life.

In this world of reinvention and shallow personality, I've started to build
the Ziggurat of what I shall become. There's need to evolve and grow, as my
child needs a better role model, than I feel myself currently being.

This month has been a struggle, but yet I remain. Each day was a fight, the
body is weary and so is the mind, but whilst there's breath, there's strength
to continue. Sometimes all I need, is the smile of my child, to look for a
better tomorrow.
