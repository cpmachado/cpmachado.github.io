Recently I grew weary of my jekyll setup, which previously powered the present
blog. The move was surprisingly simple, yet minor adjustments were in order.
I'm still looking for a solution for the bibtex plugin I used in jekyll, which
I've found no serious replacement. It might be a project I'd be interested
to take, but time is scarce.

I've found Hugo to be less flexible than jekyll's liquid language, yet powerful
as any other. Any open source project can be as flexible as you're willing to
make it, yet, as stated before, time is scarce.
