TL&DR: After last year's troubled tournament, I've not touched a chess set
properly. Some days ago decided to return to it.

Last Sunday, I went for a stroll trying to figure out the mess that we
call life, when the urge for the bitter caffeinated drug forced a stop. Passing
through the old corner, I was informed that there was a chess enthusiast in
the crowd.

Due to pressing issues, I didn't chat too much with this curious fellow, but
it made me think about chess. Chess appeared as a true and proper hobby, a
refuge from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Amidst the eight by
eight board, anyone is transported to a different world, of certainty, beauty
and rigor.

On Monday, hesitantly I packed a chessboard and the classic "My 60
Memorable Games" by the great Robert (Bobby) J. Fischer. Being a busy bee, a
book you can take for a walk, and a chess set as well. No time was found to
pick it up on Monday, but instead focused on Geometry, as an exam is in the
horizon.

Yesterday, nearing the end of the afternoon, the time was ripe to go back, and
so I did. To my dismay, as I went through the start of the first game, the
wild chess enthusiast appeared, and right after the photo below, I found
myself playing with this kind man.

It made me understand that I need to practice, as I dropped a game out of a
good few, but it also made me calm. Saudade, this Portuguese inscrutable
concept for the English language, was tingled. Soon, I see myself a day later,
writing about these curious days, and going back to chess.

Lacking availability, I'll leave my goals to just analyse games, but let us
see where it takes me.
