My life as a developer starts in 2012.


## 2012 - 2015

### Going to University


- Institute: Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia
- University: Universidade Nova de Lisboa([FCT-UNL])
- Degree: Integrated Msc in Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Status: **Incomplete** (Transferred to [IST-UL])

#### Why Electrical and Computer Engineering?

I was obsessed about Mathematics, Music and Physics. Going for engineering was
the logical step, and I don't regret it. I wonder however how my life would've
been had I gone for Physics or Mathematics.

#### Highlights

The highlights:

- Learned to Program
	+ in C originally, thus K&amp;R is one of my bibles.
- Got immersed in student exploratory projects.
	+ University should be about sharing and earning knowledge.
	+ Unsatisfied with the status quo, started a now defunct movement called
	  ***Academic Assembly***.
- Under the guidance of great people, I built a solid scientific and
  engineering background.
  + You know who you are, probably.
- Started working, and experiencing life as an adult.
	+ Worked mostly in freelance.
	+ Did a couple of internships, focusing mostly in Java and Node.Js.
	+ Had an horrible early working experience, that made me think about the
	  honesty of corporate engineering.

## 2015 - 2018

### Changing University

- Institute: Instituto Superior Técnico
- University: Universidade Lisboa([IST-UL])
- Degree: Integrated Msc in Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Status: **Incomplete** (ongoing)

#### Why the change?

Mostly due to family problems, my responsibilities doubled. Being near my
home, in Lisbon, was a major factor. After some past bad experiences, went on
to look for something better.

#### Conclusion

My workload consistently decreased, due to a serious attempt to not get
overloaded. My studies basically grew to a stall.

#### Highlights

The highlights:

- Back to the old neighbourhood, which was a good experience.
- New experiences, with new companies.
- Workload dropped, but number of freelances increased, due to a great surge
  in the MVP market for start up like companies.
- More stable contracts with regular clients.
- Some growing pains, and a lot of maturing.

Decided to stop for a year, over consistent failure in courses. It was taking
a moral toll. My idea at the time was for a longer hiatus; work in a stable
office environment; and create infrastructure to grow personally.

was taking a toll on me, compounded with several other personal problems.

### Going back to IST-UL

I felt there was need for a couple months of rest. After being restored to my
former self, I spent another month meditating about the state of affairs, and
decided to return to university.

Currently, with all the chaos of the COVID-19 era, my studies are a bit on hold.
