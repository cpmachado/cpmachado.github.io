My life can be understood in blocks of three years.

## 2012 - 2015

### Going to University


- Institute: Faculdade de CiÃªncias e Tecnologia
- University: Universidade Nova de Lisboa([FCT-UNL])
- Degree: IM in Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Status: **Incomplete** (Transferred to [IST-UL])

#### Why Electrical and Computer Engineering?

I was obsessed about Mathematics, Music and Physics. Going for engineering was
the logical step, and I don't regret it. I wonder however how my life would've
been had I gone for Physics or Mathematics.

#### Highlights

The highlights:

- Learned to Program
	+ in C originally, thus K&amp;R is one of my bibles.
- Got immersed in student exploratory projects.
	+ University should be about sharing and earning knowledge.
	+ Unsatisfied with the status quo, started a now defunct movement called
	  ***Academic Assembly***.
- Under the guidance of great minds, I built a solid scientific and
  engineering background.
  + You know who you are, probably.
- Started working, and experiencing life as an adult.
	+ Worked mostly in freelance.
	+ Did a couple of internships, focusing mostly in Java and Node.Js.
	+ Had an horrible early working experience, that made me think about the
	  honesty of corporate engineering.
- Love lost at a cost, give something that won't get lost.
- The usual.
