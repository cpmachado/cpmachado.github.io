## Background

Been away from chess, since the disease spread like wildfire through this world of ours.

My last chess tournament was over the weekend, when all got shutdown back in March 2020.

Over time, I've been in a sea of troubles, and unable to play a single game over the board.
The online game is different, and has a different feel to it, as many can attest. Nevertheless,
my dedication faltered over this time. **I'm steadily getting worse.**

Spent the last month of November failing to get any better. I reached out to my good master, to whom I owe too much.
She spoke from wisdom, and recommended:
- Work on tactics to improve the sense of security in calculation, as I'm panicking.
- one or two games per day, with a time control of no less than 15m KO, as to work on my openings.

This happened on the evening of the 1st of December of 2021, and may God bless her.
Her support can never be overstated, in this last phase of my life.

## Challenge

Spectating over the ongoing World Chess Championship, I set out to define chess goals for myself.

The first challenge is on the 12th of December of 2021.

It's the second round of the Lisbon Coup, and I'm playing the B team for my club.
I'll be facing a youth, from the main team, that outplays me for sure.
Absent a challenge, I wouldn't be motivated.

I chose to return this way, with little time to prepare, as to prove myself my resolve.

## Current status

**Results so far:**

```
  +1 -1 =0
```

Played two games so far, and my openings are terrible.
It's normal after all and coherent with my narrative.
Both these players deserve my gratitude, and respect from all, but objectively, I'm not fit to play, yet!

The games I manage to play, will be posted here whenever I can go through analysing them.

## On the quote

This quote came to me,  amidst discussing with a friend, over the game we played yesterday(4th of December).
As we are both overly attached to moves, and we should and I will overcome it.

Hopefully, we both do.
