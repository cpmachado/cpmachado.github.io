> “It has arrived.”
> \-- A phrase to haunt anyone's dreams

It's a pretty haunting phrase. Like Hemingway's “Baby shoes not worn”, it tells
infinite stories, limited only by the reader's imagination. I don't seek to set
it like that. It has arrived the time, in which old stale skills
have come to die completely.

As memory has come to pass through human experience, it normally is a sign of
worries and troubles. I like to disagree. For me, it's a clean slate. I need to
go back and work on those skills all over again. It's pleasurable, and nostalgia
is a wonderful drug. A smooth experience it is not, but a smoother than in the
past.

Today, at work I was asked for help in a Perl script. The very first scripting
language I explored, long ago. It has a feel to it, that isn't like any other.
Many criticise it, but they don't know the experience of coding in it. Such
experience, is unique to any individual. I describe it as quite peculiar.

It's excused to say, that my helping was thwarted by my lack of practice. It
does no harm, but the echo was heard once again. “It has arrived.”

It's past lunchtime, and all a lonely developer can do is go back to work. Yet
he doesn't go alone, but with the feeling in the air, that a journey back home
is in order. Be it scripting the most elegant or ugly hack for any of his
problems. He'll go back to is tool, but I'll do it in Perl.
