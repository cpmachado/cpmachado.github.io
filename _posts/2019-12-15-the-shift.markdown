This year has been a big one. So many major shifts occurred, that my compass
broke beyond repair. Spent many days, getting a new one.

It was managed through moments **self reflection, an unwavering patience and
mostly respect.**

The foe at hand is by no means trivial. Using external forces,
this battle turned in my favour, I'd like to think. As it is in matters of
war, you win some, you lose some.


I've reclaimed my status as a competent, albeit troubled programmer, and this
is a big one. Going back to university was another good one, although I'm
struggling a bit, as any other. Those who tell you otherwise, either know
nothing, or have no life.


As in Neil Young's song,

> "Love lost, such a cost.
>
> Give me things that don't get lost
>
> Like a coin that won't get tossed
>
> Rolling home to you.",


I've loved, been loved, and have lost it at a great cost. Friends have gone,
and many have stayed. You must accept some, but not all. Complacency isn't
natural. None will fight your battles for you. Believe me, I don't shy away
from many fights.

There was this little maxim, I've heard once.

> Have faith in yourself, but God knows you can't rely in any other.


It doesn't mean however it pains me, that you shouldn't create attachments
with anyone or anything. For that is a lonesome road, many can't make it, and
most don't want it. The irony, fellow reader, doesn't escape me.

I need to consider however, this new massive event.

## The Massive event

Exactly three months ago, a person bigger than life has reappeared from the
endless tides of time. She's not massive, but rather a monument to what
humanity should show.

A slender, beautiful, educated and intelligent woman that somehow rekindled my
dwindling faith in humanity. In this short time, she inadvertently managed to
save me from myself, in several separate occasions. God knows how stubborn I
am, and some friends think it more as an unstoppable force. That's how you
know, she's special, and that's an understatement.

Upon her reappearance, I've fondly reminisced about my years on the southern
side of the Tagus. We met when I was just eighteen. At the time, I was fiery
curious student who want to know just about everything. Some would call it a
pathology, I think.

A subtle deed none, not even my closest friends, have dared do it, she did it,
unbeknownst to me. Besides her endless generosity, putting up with a maniac
asking just about everything about her thesis, she mentioned that crazy person
in the acknowledgements.

If you knew how many I've helped and never was I mentioned, you'd be
flabbergasted. Tears almost came to be.

It was the start of something, that started to grow in me. It took time to
process, as I've been known to be troubled with my feelings. Vulnerability, in
my spartan mindset, is something to be fixed, not indulged. Dependency for the
lone wolf, the perspective of having a pack, is always amazing, and terribly
scary.

I've accepted it. Nowadays, thinking of her always puts me calm. "Something",
by the Beatles, echoes through my head. A bit of REM's "Creep" too, but lets
focus on the positive.

No matter what happens, I'll always be happy to have found her. As per our
conversations, when writing about her, I lose track of time. Got to do the
good work. We don't want me failing any courses this semester.

I hope so.

For this, I leave an acknowledgement, and a dedication.

To you, love. A prime example among the ilk of women, and humanity. May you
inspire me to the foreseeable future, and our connection never sour.

I'm happy, like in Pharrell's song.
