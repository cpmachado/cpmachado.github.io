For those who know me personally, it's not news that life's been kind of harsh
in my twenties. For the last few days I took drastic measures, and start to
organize my whole life, with reasonable goals. This sounds crazy as it sounds
a completely unreasonable goal from the start.

## GitHub and my cleanup

I've been around for years with many different handles, for the other ones I
care little nowadays. This one had around 40+ repositories associated with it,
spread across different organizations.

The solution was simple, backup all that is not relevant for anyone, and
simply remove them.

Results:
- Reduced to 10 relevant repositories.

## Statistics and R

After cleaning up, I set up a new repository as I study statistics for an Exam
in September. It's almost complete:

## Life, tasks and Cybersecurity

Currently trying to pivot to cybersecurity. I've some drafts for some
articles, but still have to research more.

Currently doing the study paths at <https://letsdefend.io>

It's mostly focused on blue team ops, which is the type of career I'm looking
for.

## Conclusion

It was an eventful year full progress, setbacks, and hopefully I'm in the
right direction.
