Been reading **Albert Camus**' "Stranger". There is something hypnotic about it. It's my favourite.
Today, I'm finished up again, and appear to be mesmerized by some parts of it. There is this
paragraph, every one should know. I try not to translate, but to only mention.

It speaks of days being long to live, and how they pile on. The endless routine, the prisons of our
design, that drive days to be nameless. It comes to a point when only "Yesterday", and "Tomorrow"
have any sense, and even then.

I try to resist it, but I can't. I think of the next week. So far, it seems, when I realize it was
already last week. Time flies by, because it piles on. There's a rhythm to life. It doesn't go too
fast or too slow. It goes as it goes.

Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow remain the words that in the mess appear to describe some truth.
