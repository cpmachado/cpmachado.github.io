Some time ago, I was around twenty. Two people of whom I have the utter most respect, asked this
question. They both sought the same answer. In both cases, I've failed. I was young, reckless, and a
bit unorthodox. In a fatherly way, they taught me.

Engineering is nothing more than a method. It's a protocol to apply knowledge to produce something.
This is a trivial explanation, because even now I fail to answer it. The concept is seeded in my
mind. The application is faulty. I need practice. What it is not, is what a technician does.

I feel nowadays there are almost no engineers around the world, that I know. I watch mostly
technicians. I watch hoodies calling themselves engineers, but they don't understand. The industrial
complex that created our educational system, used to praise engineers. Nowadays, I think it's
different. Whence today, I'd rather be call an hacker, that tries to make things work, than an
engineer. FYI, I'm not an engineer, I'm what they call a *"software developer"*.

An engineer today, appears to be a mere technician, with all due respect. The world needs them more
than engineers. Yet the world needs engineers too. I see the **hacker** culture disintegrating and
being a bucket of meaningless concepts. I'm not a purist, I'm not a teenager. I just long for the
times, when being an engineer, and working as one was true. True hackers, nowadays, are the last of
the ilk of engineers.

Engineers are on the verge of extinction. Companies want only instant results. They behave as badly
educated children. Even those I praise with such status, drop themselves on their knees. What is
engineering to me? Today? A mere fantasy.
