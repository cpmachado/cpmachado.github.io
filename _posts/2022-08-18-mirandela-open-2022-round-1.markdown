TL&DR: My return has been ridden with issues, decided to go to
**Mirandela Open 2022**,
and lost the first game for the same reasons as always. Talking about the
experience

We played a Berlin Defense, which I wasn't too scared of, as my analysis of
Carlsen, Anand, and Kramnik games went deep, some couple years ago. We ended
up transposing to a strange Steinitz.

My opponent blundered, and blundered good. It's normal, as it's the first
round of the tournament, and people are tired. God, I know I was.

After 14. Nd5, I know I'm winning, but after 14. ... Qh4, I started panicking.
My analysis doesn't limit itself to this, yet I'm too tired to write it down
here, maybe I'll update it after the tournament.

The gist is that I panicked, and started seeing ghosts, and completely
floundered my chance for a nice game afterwards. The same problem remains, I'm
not very disciplined mentally, and mostly when it comes about classic chess.

I'll try my best for the rest of the tournament, because it was really a pity.
My opponent was an Olympiad player, and this could've been a game to remember
on a better note.

As Camus used to say, be like Sisyphus, and smile towards adversity.

## Aftermath

Lost a game that could've been great, but I still got 8 rounds to go.
