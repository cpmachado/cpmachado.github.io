Taking the medication. Apathy rules my soul. I could endure all emotional pain, just for my body to
show. My mind is in another place.  It focus only in tasks. Once such task is the end of life. Why
endure if life isn't being experienced? Why live without beauty? Why live with everything feeling
the same?

I don't know any of the answers for these questions. I just seek to survive. Haunted of course, but
enduring. Someday it will be different. Or maybe not, and I'm being carried on by an illusion.
Idealist as I once praised to be, makes me coherent.

Just an hour ago, my mother in suffering, was trying to reason with me, but my face was emotionless.
She is worried. Then I start crying, but I feel nothing. Is my anxiety getting to me, beyond the
help, or is it just my physiological response? I sure feel sedated. There is nothing to rock my
world. I could sing “Across the Universe” by the Beatles.

Awareness of the need for change, doesn't elude me. I simply don't care. I wonder what comes next.
Who wouldn't given the circumstances? I don't know. It's unnerving how ignorant and indifferent a
human being can be.
