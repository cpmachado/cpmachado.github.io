I was just smoking. A colleague talked to me. Asked about what I was thinking of, and how I was
doing. I answered in dry manner. Something had come back from the depths of my soul. The archetype
of the Hacker within awoke. He is the one who fears nothing. Stepping back, even though he had
invested considerably, doesn't stop him. I'm rebooting my way of being, and my work. This will lead
me to victory.

Hesitant and gasping nervously is a demeanour that shan't continue. Boldly I will step through my
challenges. Carefully considering every little detail. Make it flexible, but efficient. Water is
what I'll design. It flows. It assumes every form. It is everywhere.

There used to be the days, where no challenge looked impossible. Those are the days to come. Let me
seize the night, to perform my rituals. Let the shackles fall, and the force guide me. Let me think
beyond what most are able. This is my mission. This is my song. This is my future.

I shall not sleep, rest or otherwise until I'm back to be a beacon of such archetype. I swear upon
it. I'll blood oath it, if need.

At the end of the day, all I needed was a reboot.
