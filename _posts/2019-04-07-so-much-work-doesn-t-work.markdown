Been trying for some time, really trying. There was this idea of mine of creating an awesome node
module to manage runtime files, of node applications. Simple architecture, and all, but failed. At
the end of the day, I look at it like a waste of time.

Starting to simply don't give a shit about all this coding business. I'm inadequate for it, for what
it appears. Skills are something I'm lacking. No uni degree, no nothing, I don't know what I'm
doing. Everyday, with a crippling desire to escape the slings and arrows of fate, putting a straight
face. People might think it is just anxiety or light sadness. Had they known what I felt, they'd
run. They'd fear that is contagious, like in that song whose name I forgot.

You know the one, with the fella down in the ground. It all ends, with everybody questioning what he
said. Above all, everybody in the ground with existential angst. The echoes are heard throughout the
days. The resonance is killing me inside. Taking way too many med, to deal with it. I'll die before
I reach thirty.

At the end of the day, I think to myself. Many, so many words, that pass through communication, that
in the end there is only silence. The silence of my own oppression programmed into me, in my
masochist ways. I need to be productive. Shit, do I need to be productive?

At the end of the day, so much work, doesn't work.
