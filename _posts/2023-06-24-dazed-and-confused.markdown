Had a couple of rough weeks. I was so happy for my assignment score in Discrete
Mathematics, that I actually thought I was meant to be taking this degree.

Last Thursday, it was the global evaluation, and didn't look that bad.
God knows my hubris came to bite me. Went against a wall. The sorry excuse for
a student might survive, but his ego took a toll.

Afterwards, tried to verify answers to see a circular logic, based in air and
smoke, without actual fire to feed it. Questions arise, is there still fuel to
continue? Albeit my faith is holding me together, loneliness is haunting my
frail mind.

Thoughts run at the speed of light, and there's nothing that stays, as the
trail goes cold, so does any memory of it.
