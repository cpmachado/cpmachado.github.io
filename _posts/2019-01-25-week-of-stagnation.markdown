Last week, felt good about myself and my work. I dominated my obstacles and
triumphed. Today, at the end of this week, I feel weary and depressed for how
underwhelming it was. Don't get me wrong. Goals were met. Only a bit of
documentation left over, and casually being taken care of.

Writing never bothered me anyway. Be it code or documentation, patience is
abundant within. This blue week has taken its toll on my body. January never
seems to end. Then again, I'm not looking forward for February. A big tournament
is in the horizon. I don't run away from a fight, but I like to prepare. Going
in blind never played in my favour.

I'm in zugzwang. This German chess term, meaning the compulsion to move,
describes life. Sometimes, all I want is to resign. The game of life, in the big
plan, is of little importance. Nevertheless, you must go on. You can't pass your
turn. The ball is in your court.

The question lingers in the air. To be or not to be. The great soliloquy of
Hamlet, written by the great bard. He knew. The absurdity of life never
disappoints. I'm tired, once again. I leave thee two great soliloquy's.

Macbeth's soliloquy, performed by Patrick Stewart


   Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;  
There would haue beene a time for such a word:  
To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,  
Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,  
To the last Syllable of Recorded time:  
And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles  
The way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,  
Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,  
That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,  
And then is heard no more. It is a Tale  
Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury  
Signifying nothing.
