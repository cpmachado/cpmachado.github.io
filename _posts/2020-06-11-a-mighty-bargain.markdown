Another crazy rambling of any other day, whence the lunatic folk ravage upon my
worthless time.

It was the glorious day of the Feast of Corpus Christi. Amidst my troubled
day, having a cup of coffee was in order. The cellular phone rings, as
notifications pour, over connecting to the accursed wireless network access at
the coffee shop. Embarrassment soon follows.

Having been seated, I roll over notifications. No more than two, praised be
the lord. It was my good captain, with riddles to test one's wit. Reason be
obscured, I promptly offered my service to my dear superior. She'd ask if I'd
might be a creative type. My heart plummeted for a fraction of a second.

Given thought, I answered:

> "I was a musician, and am a writer and engineer, thus rather yes than no".

Pardon my horrible grammar, as I was stumbling my thumbs on the wretched phone.
The heart pounded ever so normally, and nothing was out of the ordinary, except
for my own inept capability to deal with such devices. Shortly after, few
seconds might have been, the challenge is given. It was written as so:

> "On a Sunday morning, while having your morning coffee(or tea), you hear a
> knock on the door. You to the door, but find no one; only 3 boxes. You look
> around but can't see anyone. You open the biggest one and find a penguin. You
> open the next one and see there is a cage with a parrot. When you open the
> smallest one, you find a frog.
>
> What are you going to do?

The mind blew, and creativity kind of faltered. Then a glimpse of some macabre
intention appeared to be unveiled. After breathing as normally as I'd be doing,
I answer tersely, what any unimaginative fellow would have done:

> Check if they are alright.
>
> Call a veterinary.
>
> Call animal control.
>
> Before the last, take a photo of the penguin and make some Linux joke.

It is so, I've come to find out that I'm a plain fellow, with a plain life.
Jogging sarcasm over irregular and muddy ground, as to swiftly carry on with my
life. I inquired the captain over her opinion, and she answered that there was
none. As soon as she spoke it, some foul play filled the air, as I felt
tricked. Or truly, not really, I just kept going talking nonsense, as it is
some tenth of our conversation.

Considering it, I even observed that some pervert would try to procreate with
them. Now I wonder, if it is overly insensitive, that some Chinese would be
eagerly happy and say that dinner for the next week is had. I don't know,
maybe. I care little for the inclinations or sensitivity of such stupid
mindless drones, thus I've written it. The Chinese would eat the bunch, as in
the stereotypes.

A promise of two thousand words was made, but my weak brain managed slightly
over five hundred. Let us pray so, that in her ultimate wisdom, she will give
herself to mercy, and give this poor chap an answer.

P.S.- A French would totally eat the frog. Forgot about that one.
