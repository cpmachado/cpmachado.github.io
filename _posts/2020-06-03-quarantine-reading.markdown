Been trying to write since the last true post, in December. Honesty
should prevail, lately my will to write has shivered amidst a roller coaster of
emotions. Been miserable and happy, but lonely no more.

Most of the time, I've been quite happy. It's an odd feeling, for the
existential despair ridden old me. Nice as it is, it comes with some downsides.
Not to be the caricature of the bourgeois writer, that in order to write, misery
should be aching. It does so help, when you feel tired as hell to use it as a
motivator. I'm by no means a professional, for professionals, sit and write,
edit and re-edit, until something proper comes out.

So it is that I'm the eternal amateur in everything. Even though I once claimed
to be professional at some trades, for work in them I did. I look back, and
nothing of sort can be assumed. I dabble around, like a pig in filth. Lately,
a more realistic(some call pessimist) attitude stood out, and proper employment
has come to be set as priority.

Work I'm looking for, and work I shall find.

On another topic, that made me feel miserable, let us talk about the
quarantine. Anxiety stricken over the whole affair, I turned to manual labour.
I found the joy of baking. It has come as a complete surprise. My mother
wouldn't even believe it, had it not been my fair companion to tell her so.
Baking has become one of the most cathartic activities I regularly practice
nowadays.

Whilst some may practice yoga, I bake. It makes my girl happy, as she has a
sweet tooth herself. My traditional coping mechanisms have faltered in the
meanwhile. I used to read and write extra, in these times. It is strange to me
to read less, and explore even less ever since. I've seen the opposite taking
over my friends.

Some of them, who would not pick up a book to save their lives, but rather only
exams, have become prolific readers. As such, with some encouragement, I'm
going to start to read once again.

On my bedstead, lays *L'Envers et L'Endroit* by Albert Camus. Let the reading
begin. As self isolation, more than before is in the order of the day.
Gradually as there are a relaxing of the measures, the numbers are
skyrocketing. An uneasy feeling takes over, but the courage to overcome it
burns twice as bright. Let it be, let it be so.
