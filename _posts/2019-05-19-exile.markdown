After two weeks of exile, I relive the routine. An anti-pattern of my life,
when certain things go awry. Some relief is attained, but the ruins need to
built upon. Shadows lurk in any street corner. A new trail is to be threaded,
with uncertainty being my only companion.

Life's an adventure, than insane a man make. I wrote this sentence once, in a
poem. It was followed by: For the paradox, and sanity's sake. It was an
interesting little poem, from a collected group on my last reboot. This uneasy
strange feeling of being in stranger's life, makes it all familiar, yet
foreign. It's a little dissonance. It resembles visiting some city in your
country, that's just a bit different culturally.

There's a certain mystic about it. I am still crossing a desert,
unfortunately. Something appears to be in the horizon. What it is, I don't
know, but it is something.
