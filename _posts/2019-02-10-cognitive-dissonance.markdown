It's well known, for all who've met me, that I don't praise Psychology. To say
the least, I give it the minimum respect possible. It has been changed lately,
as I delve to understand myself. I've found the notions of social archetypes an
interesting instrument to analyze myself.

I relate a little too much to the Warrior Archetype. Being so self absorbed and
insecure on what I am, or should be, I degenerate into its symmetric. The Shadow
Warrior is by no means as good as its name sounds. It's explicitly the most
pathetic thing I could be, in my opinion.

YouTube videos and articles in the Interweb is all my research has come to be.
That is about to change. Just ordered a really nice book on it. Well, a friend
ordered it for me. I don't like to order stuff. Anyhow, its name is "King,
Warrior, Magician, Lover: Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine".
It's written by Robert Moore and Douglas Gillette.

There is so much praise for this book, one can only hope not being disappointed.
Let us see. Until then, I'm on a Sunday writing documentation, I should've
finished during the week.

See you in yet another day.
