> How lovely it is to start taking something that steals all your joy away?

Pretty depressing is an adequate description. Life driven by suicidal
tendencies, can't be “healthy”. Overbearing generosity was taking over, and I
just wanted to share all of it with everybody. You know, suicide everybody.
Now the pills are back, and I'm lonely with my thoughts.
I do duck suicide every hour or so, but could be worse.

Getting slightly less overwhelmed and more productive. We have to be optimistic.
Still getting used to them again. Just trying not to overthink the fact. The
fact these precious little things are back, and how I said **f\*\*\* no** in
other occasions.

They are back. Got to deal with it. Need is exaggerated, yet I was losing
control of reality. Just about everything was cluttering my thoughts. Being
back, just means I need to function better now. Under the light of all this, a
friend once told me to move with some family in the country side. Casually code
freelance until I was better.

Nonsense of course. Some people don't understand coding. They think it is just
pressing keys, and magic happens. They overestimate its difficulty, but
underestimate the work it gives. Look all around, the  hundreds, thousands,
millions or so lines of code, someone has to write everyday so that you can
share cat photos or something.

I'm back on the drugs. It's life. I'll try not to get addicted, or use them as
an excuse for my countless failures.
