After being short of breath for a couple weeks, I've risen again. Stuck in this
cycle of mania and euphoria. I still stand alienated from this world of ours. I
can't but focus on work. Life slips through my fingers, and I can't do a thing
about it. There is no equilibrium to be had.

To deal with the scarce time I own, and not into a psychosis fueled loop, I've
decided to focus in data driven projects. There is always something to be learnt
about any other thing. I've just got to be careful over the noise within this
world. The buzz that only you hear, and doesn't leave you alone.

My words may sound from the depths of an asylum. It is known. The thing is that
the intent is merely to express a perspective about this world of ours. In
which, any human heart, has multiple beings. There is the physical being, the
digital representations, and the legal representation. The links that connect
them all are getting stronger.

These links are nothing but handcuffs. Nevertheless, they are access points to
be used to try to understand us. People have never been so exposed. For the best or
the worst, it can be useful. Even amongst the turmoil of this data Tsunami,
there must be something good out of it. It can't only be this social crisis and
all it's layers.

Until I find out, I'll be navigating these seas of data. I'll do it for good,
and not lose my mind.
