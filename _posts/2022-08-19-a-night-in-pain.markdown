## A night in pain

None could've been more wrong. As soon as I was about to leave the hotel, I
collapsed by the entrance. The pain was unlike anything I've experienced since
a similar incident in 2020.

My back was aching, and I expected it to be nothing more, but I was wrong
again. My guts flared up, and then it hit me. I've been experiencing some
strange lack of appetite for the last week or so, and couldn't put my
finger on the cause.

After this blazing night, I've concluded that it was with an irritated colon, 
due to stress. I never lie, except when there's need. I don't overreact, but
sometimes I jest. I'm not doing it here.

Basically, I was literally full of it. Every single movement I did, something
hurt. Couldn't stand up, or lie down, and barely sit. The good people on the
organization of the chess tournament helped me. Can't thank them enough.

After sitting mildly comfortably for a couple hours in the hotel lobby, I went
on the adventure to drag myself to my room. It took me nearly 20m, with an
elevator ready.

Everything was aching, and my shorts pulling on my back were as bad as searing
pokes of iron. After I arrived and managed to lie down naked on the bed, a
certain relief came.

After certain arrangements, to whom I thank the hotel staff, which have been
impeccable as well, I ordered a couple pizzas to have some food stock. I was
still unaware of the cause, but I had already given notice I wouldn't be
playing the third round of the tournament.

The pizza came about, I ate, talked with the boss, and my mom, and as soon as
the carbs hit, I was sleeping. It was around 9PM.

## Middle of the night(3:30 AM)

Wake up desperate to go to the bathroom, and I feel slightly better, for a
second. As soon as I get up, the pain is even worse. On the ensuing hours I
understand my condition.

## Morning of despair

Around 9AM I call my dad, but he's busy. I manage to talk with my doctor(aka
grandma) and my mom, they settle on what I should do. So I put my faith on the
hotel staff again, and it was true.

They went to get me the medication, and I'm slowly recovering. I'm in no
condition to play, and I already gave notice to remove me of the tournament,
as I don't know when I'll recover.

## Aftermath

It's close to the round, and for the first time I can sit and type these
words. As stated, it still aches, and I'm still recovering, and god knows how
I even feared something worse than this.
