overboard.

Having lost, it made me think about the trajectory of things. Due to stress
induced by this whole affair, when I went to my room, it hit me. A
striking, and merciless back pain holding no punches.

It happens from time to time, when my nerves are a bit shot. It's a beautiful
alarm clock within my body, but a bit wicked and twisted. Spent the last 3
hours in bed, relaxing and thinking about it all.

For some odd reason, I completely enjoy these moments of agony. They sharpen
me up. Pain is just pain, it is here, it comes, it goes, you ignore it, or
not. Most of the times, one must admit you can't ignore it. This situation
is however an old friend.

Thus after 3 glorious hours, I got up, and struggled to the balcony. Grabbed
my cigarette, and thought about it. The power of mind over matter is something
that I'm still to understand. Somehow my body starts aching, whenever I overdo
the grey matter.

Is this a survival instinct to make me reassess my conditions, and strive for
a better solution/move? Maybe, I do nothing, but speculate. The thing is that
it looks like it's just conjured up, nothing more, nothing less. Another
question remains. Why do I do this to myself? To be further investigated.
