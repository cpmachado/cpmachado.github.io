Relief or some peace can be achieved, by running away. It is a bad habit, I've
tried to break. Failure to manage it, frustration gives rise to indifference. I
ran away again. It comes at a cost, no less than some regret. It broke my heart
a little to leave this job of mine.

It was the right thing to do, for everyone. It hurt me though, to leave my team,
my colleagues, my third family. Can't stop wondering about them. Time will make
it fade away, for sure. Some part of me though, stays there in a manic cycle of
over diligence to failure.

Time to part ways with failure, let success be had by these lucky few, who try,
and try again, and never cease until it is said and done. Today, I'm going to
dust off my typewriter and back to work on my book, that has gone neglected for
some three months.

Au revoir
