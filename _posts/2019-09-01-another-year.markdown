Another year has come to pass. The end of an era is in the horizon. Tonight,
I reach the twenty five years of life, and the return of a seasonal exile.
Three or four months of self reflection, of death and rebirth. Succeeding and
failing, not only a necessity, but there's need of a deeper one. A true
revolution. It could be called a rite of passage for me.

There is little to care about laps around the sun, for its intrinsic value.
However something about time and efficiency is similar, yet different and a
important factor to consider. It's obviously an obsession of mine, shared with
many others. Questions flood my mind. Just to name a few:
- What was achieved this year, on its own?
- What progress was made?
- What was learned, and to learn from?

It was a very complicated one, I must admit. Hindsight imbues all events with
a certain degree of absurdity. Quoting and applying the bard's words can be
useful. All these were full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

I've been told it's a crude and harsh perspective. My nature and reasoning
tends to disagree. Faithful to my beliefs, I stand. Excellence can only be
achieved by such uncompromising stances. Civilization and evolution are the
ultimate goals. The issue is the blindness, that seldom comes from it.
Dogmatism has a certain adherence to such views.

Back to the subject, through sorrow and pain, once again I've relearned
forgotten lessons. It was tough, full of honest attempts and failures, the
causes not fully understood. From what I gather, a general logistic and
discipline problem. Hence there is more to be rethought and planned.

Priorities have to be reestablished. Going back to study doesn't stand on its
own. My heart must be into it. Sacrifices must be made. Existence must be. For
hell is full of good intentions. There are too many "musts". I'm aware of the
text, but is the only word adequate to describe the feeling. Laws set on
stone, with armies of rhetoric and guilt to hold it true. Besides the obvious
obsession to conform to written rules. Programming is my job after all.

Let us conclude my short whimsical rant.

Another year, another man inhabiting the same identity. Promises are made.
Promises are broken. Promises must be fulfilled. As the knights of old, I'd
like to differ only in the murdering and riding part. The goal is clear. The
game is set. Let us play.
