> -- Spoken by an asshole I praise, echoed in the Interweb

Been hovering around the Interweb for a few years now. Had some blogs, yet
nothing too serious. I cared little about them. Recently, change has become a
moral imperative. I should start to care.

The absurdity of everyday life never stops to leave a mark.

Thus, I've decided to follow the cool kids' example, in them social networks.
Let me bitch about such happenings. You know, like the amazing maxims of the
gifted people I find throughout my days.

Today was a riot. Still obsessed about a conversation, from yesterday. I live in
a bizarre land. Some call it country. I start to doubt whatever it is. In this
great paradise, even the right wing movements go on strike.

It looks strange, but heed my words. Nurses, judges and some other big shots go
on strike. It's time for an absurdity list.
- If the judges go on an illegal strike, who does condemn them?
- If Justice is on its heels, what does that mean? Can I go punch a politician
and not be persecuted for aggression?
- In the case of the nurses, they boast crowdfunding money for their cause.

### Nurses, in whose interest

In whose interest does this movement get stronger?

The good people in the private sector are happy. Their profits skyrocket, while
they enjoy the show. The great question is if they are eating popcorn. I'm not
one of those savages that eat it in the cinema, but I wonder if they are.

Day by day, as our national health system is crashing and burning. Public
confidence has never been so low. Another interesting question haunts me.

#### Is this only common business practice or just plain treason?

I don't know. I just wonder. Giggling in the hallways at the office, like the
madman I've become.

### Conclusion

This looks like a proper start for this place of mine. We going to be friends,
you'll see.
