Awoke at six, as expected. Still in a dream state, fell on the bed again to wake
up at half past eight. Got late to work, according to my own schedule. I was
hoping to be working at seven. A couple hours later shouldn't be so harmful.
The point isn't falling asleep. It's staying asleep.

The sheer inertia to awake and live, is one of my great struggles. Being aware
of my weaknesses, but at the same time idealizing surpassing them. In the end, I
stay the same. However, the sleeper must awaken. Change must occur.

This is not the Beatles song, “Across the Universe”. Something needs to change
my world. Be it flesh, blood, or just plain old suffering. I've grown too used
to my current status. I must evolve.

Yesterday, I almost lost yet another game. Impatience is plenty to go all
around. Focus is in dire need. Survival depends on it. It was a merciless fight,
just for survival.
