TL&DR: The second round of the **Mirandela Open 2022** went horribly. Beyond
reason, and in pure emotion, failure was short of disaster. Drama for everyone,
given and sold.

## The Game

Another game, another loss, can't say too much about this game. As a deranged
idiot, I went back on what I was trying to do. From move 3, I was
blitzing, anxious and desperate to leave the playing hall.

It was the worst experience for me, since the last game of the last tournament
I played, which was pretty nasty. I got mated in 15 moves in the
aforementioned game, in this at least I held on for 34 moves, before
resigning.

The thought passed through my mind of Curt Von Bardeleben the game. This
means to leave, without saying a word to anyone. Better judgement came above
insanity.


## Aftermath

The overall feeling is of a profound frustration. From the start the odds were
obviously against me, I just hated how I played. Above all the act of playing
quickly.

Yesterday was a pretty solid game compared to this piece of things, that I
played. My thoughts go to that Macbeth soliloquy which deepens my existential
chess angst. It's beautiful nevertheless.

Stating the fact, there 7 rounds to go.
