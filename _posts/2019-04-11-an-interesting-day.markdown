Today, I had lunch with a friend. He's an IT recruiter for a living. Not a stereotype, he actually
cares about people. Just before meeting him, I was cleaning up the documentation at work. Having
tough days, concentrating and all. It's almost midnight and only now, I found true inspiration for
a partial fix in one of my tickets.

Something isn't right with me. Life gets to all. Heard a guy resigned at the office. He was a nice
guy. Alike to my person, with a wee bit problem with nerves. Before lunch, I was resolute in
quitting. Honestly, I was. After it, started second guessing it. Keeping my distance though.

Feeling inadequate for my position. I have a great team, and I'm supported as much as possible.
Nevertheless I still struggle. There's something wrong with me. Going to talk with my boss tomorrow.
He's a good man, and he really tries to understand me. In most places, I'd been laid off way way
back. I admire him for that.

It's really almost midnight. I'm at a cinema's cafe writing, and I feel peaceful. Maybe writing is
the thing I should be doing. Not writing code, but proper writing. Writing about the joys and woes
of the average Joe. Writing about the questions that haunt me and many others. Write about the
Absurd that strikes you at any corner of life. Who knows?

Sometimes I wonder, if this is normal. You know, having no clue what do you want for yourself at the
 age of twenty-four. Going back home now, to the beautiful empty streets. It's midnight.
