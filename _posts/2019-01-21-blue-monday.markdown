[![Blue Monday Video][Video-image]][Video-link]


Today, we live the infamous faux holiday. Blue Monday, they call it. The first
time I heard of it, I said "nice". Thought they were talking about New Order's
song, which is a favourite of mine. Feel free to hear it on YouTube, just press
the image.

Looked into the origins, and it has to do with a study done back in 2005. Being
honest, I'm feeling too lazy to read it today. Busy day at work, and I'm plenty
tired for the day. You can read about it in the Wikipedia page
[here][Wiki-article]. From the little I've read, it's one of those trendy days.

> Everyday has something about it, nowadays.

It tries to model environment variables and impacts on people's mood. In this
case, it talks about the weather, Christmas' credit card bills, and little more.
It is sloppy, as expected. There is little to say about this kind of "study".

You just need some conditions:
1. Some idiot with a fancy diploma 
2. The idiot being prone to:
	- sell his signature
	- seeking fame with ludicrous allegations
3. Useless pseudo-science is born

There is no honour about cash money, unless you are a proper merc. There is
none, nowadays. People sell themselves and others for pennies. Nobody cares
about anything anymore. This is me, on a blue Monday or month. January has
always been tough on me.

Over and out. See you around.
