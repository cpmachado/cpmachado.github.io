Today, we live the infamous faux holiday. Blue Monday, they call it. The first
time I heard of it, I said "nice". Thought they were talking about New Order's
song, which is a favourite of mine. Feel free to hear it on YouTube, just press
the image.

Looked into the origins, and it has to do with a study done back in 2005. Being
honest, I'm feeling to lazy to read it today. Busy day at work, and I'm plenty
tired for the day. You can read the Wikipedia page [here][Wiki-article]. From
the little I've read, it's one of those trendy days, because every day is about
something.

It essentially tries to model environment variables and its impact on people's
mood. In this case, it talks about the weather, and Christmas' credit card
bills. It is sloppy, as it was expected. There is little to say about this kind
of modelling. You have some idiot with a fancy diploma. The idiot sells is
signature, or is just a plain idiot, and this kind of pseudo-science is born.

There is no honour about cash money, unless you are a proper merc. There is
none, nowadays. People sell themselves and others for pennies. Nobody cares
about anything anymore. This is me, on a blue Monday, or month. January has
always been tough on me.

Over and out. See you around.
