It's Monday again. It's a new day and I'm feeling good. Had a terrible weekend,
with the typical seasonal depression. To pile up on my misery, I got zeroed in
the first 3 rounds of the **Portugal Open 2019**. Can't stop blundering pieces,
for some reason.

The worst thing is the guilt felt in the air. I really have to stop blaming
myself over things that I can't control. Why couldn't my opponents blunder some
more? That'd be perfect. Statistically unlikely, according to their rating, yet
possible. We live in an imperfect world, after all.

Today, it's a new day. Working early and all going well. Looked a bit over my
games, and they are pretty horrible. 

Here are my games(those are the first three):

I need to focus. Maybe, I'll start working on this kind of situation. Stoicism
seems as a line of thought to inspire such endeavours.

Even with this weekend of mine, I'm good. I'm feeling great about myself.
