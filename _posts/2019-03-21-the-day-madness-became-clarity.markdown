A few months of bad days, ever since I started coding again. There were good days too, but mostly
bad. The endless routine turns my screws. Turn, turn, turn... Not being recovered or prepared, chaos
ensued.

Looking from a distance, I see more madness around me, than I care to stand. People fixate in
trivial things. All that is art, science, engineering and other turns to ruble. What saddens me the
most is being so alienated from these people. Wishing only to have their disease, I face myself with
invulnerability.

Back to work, I see the Node Js community going awry. You trust everybody, because you have no sense
of fear. Checking the code of many of these popular tools, makes me puke. Their code is for shit.
Complex blobs of narcissism written only to get self elation. You know, like these words I write.

Coping with all this is a struggle. A struggle beyond my means. Religiously I take it all. Code is
art. Engineering is art. Living is art. Elegance doesn't subdue functionality, but it counts for
something. So I thought, but I guess I'm wrong, according to the "sane" ones. Comfortable in their
chairs, they do the least to survive. They settle, when they should push. In the end, a blood
sacrifice appears to be the solution. This meaning, to go the extra mile.

For the last couple months, I've tirelessly try to meet my deadlines and fail. Outside work,
rewriting all these basic functionalities to something deemed honest. Now, endeavouring into yet
another frenzy, to write a proper javascript linter. I see all these linters, either falling down
from their essence or being designed as bloated time bombs.

At the end of the day, it makes sense. The tech lead doesn't want competition. They screw the little
guy by feeding them pots of shit. Never have we ever had so much power. Never have we been so
illiterate or sabotaged from the beginning. The FSF appears to have been taken over. FOSS and
FLOSS too, by these big corporations that have seen a way to massively indoctrinate the masses.

I thank for my feature rich and bloated software. Had it not been so, I wouldn't be aware of all
this. The sacrifice we do for all this. Convenience, for our lives.

We programmers have a social responsibility. I've failed at it, and as the hypocrite any other is, I
write these words.
