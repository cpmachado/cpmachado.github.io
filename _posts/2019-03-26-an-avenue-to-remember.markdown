Under the darkness of night and life, we tend to hold some memories dearly.
In the gloom of my current status, there's this one night, when I was here in my
neighbourhood. An Avenue behind the church that is. At night, there are always a few cars passing
by. They appear to be taking the pace of the beautiful melody of the ensemble.

I remember the smile of friends, when I told them. They joked about it and considered an
absurdity. They knew not of the beauty of that avenue in that night. There is this equilibrium that
is hard to explain. Just like any other moment in life, it must be experienced. A monologue of
Shakespeare is great by itself, but beyond in magnitudes, when felt.

Every friend knows my favourite monologue. It's in Macbeth after he had lost his wife. A broken man
contemplates life as a whole. He sees only the absurdity. He's grim and set on the end.
Understanding not all it has to offer, but making a cold objective analysis. There is indeed a pace
that creepes from day to day.
A never ending mark of time going and going. We aren't eternal, and that's quaint, to say the least.

Had there been any man with his own avenue, somewhere and somewhen? I don't know. I like to think
so. Then again, I'll have it, for now.
Today, I have my avenue, and its beauty appears to rival that of the floating bag in “American
Beauty”.
