I'm enjoying the day, as anyone can. Anyone that has quit his job. Bound only to settle unresolved
issues, regarding my departure. I'm a bit broken about all this. Disappointment is hard to evade.
Regret comes to mind, but it seems just a manifestation of fear for uncertainty. Life goes on. I'm
twenty-four, and there's still a lot to live. Some hope so.

Lucidity, sobriety or what you may call it, comes to confess that it was needed. I say goodbye, with
a smile. What can any man do, when he abandons his family for selfish reasons? I don't know, yet I
say goodbye. Goodbye.
