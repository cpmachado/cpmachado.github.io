Life took a turn. Questions give rise to decisions, yet to be made.
Everything must be thought out. Hesitation is intolerable, but caution is
advised. Fear runs low, as always. It's a sign of my own stupidity, or that
somehow I've computed the consequences and see little risk. Everything being
weighed and analyzed.

It's a cumbersome task. Sheer necessity demands it. Stability and misery, or
something else is on the table. The past question was exactly formed in those
terms. Now, the real question still eludes me, as many cloud my mind. What is
real and important? What is just smoke and mirrors?

It's an ungrateful position to be in, but then again required.

Faith and Logic guide my heart and actions. There is only space for human
error. The single problem is accepting the decisions to be made. What comes of
them, must be dealt with. What has been done is done. There is always some
reluctance about it.

The shroud of uncertainty always haunts rational beings, but the zugzwang of
life always pushes one to press forward. There is nothing to go back for.

On a personal account, I'll never live this day again, or be this age. I'll
never be the nineteen year old, I've come to idealize as my peak. There is
little to be gained in living in the past. Just your memories. The history of
your life, all the joys and sorrows have propelled you to this very moment.

There is use in visiting, but not reliving.

It's the end of an era for me. It might be the same for you. Remember just
that you can never go back or leave your life on hold. The question lingers in
the air. **_"What to do?"_**
