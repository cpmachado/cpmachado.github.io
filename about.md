### Labels

Labels suck. Nevertheless, useful to communicate with lazy minded people.

A small list of labels about myself:
- Chess Player(mediocre)
- Mathematics enthusiast(amateur)
- Engineer(in essence, I don't own a diploma)
- Hacker(Not in the pop sense, but in morbidly curious human being)
- Twenty something man(currently 24)
- Former student at FCT-UNL(3 years), in Electrical and Computer Engineering
- Former student at IST-UL(3 years), in Electrical and Computer Engineering
- University dropout
- Currently working as a backend developer
- Writer of strange tales(e.g. what's here)
- Serial Reader
